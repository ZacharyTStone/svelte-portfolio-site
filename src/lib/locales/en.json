			"description": "Main Tasks:\n \n - Worked on bug tickets, support tasks, and new features.\n \n - Worked directly with clients and helped write BRDs, feature briefs, tech specs, and other documentation.\n \n - Coordinated with design, engineering, and product teams.\n \n Accomplishments:\n \n - I created a highly reusable, robust project component library following a Figma file.\n \n- Planned and created an embeddable widget as part of a feature. This was a unique ask for the company, and I took responsibility for the research and front-end planning and implementation. After completing the feature, I met with companies' engineering teams directly to ensure a smooth implementation regardless of their website's framework.\n \n- Worked with QA to update to my project's QA process. This included better QA instructions, a weekly code review, a release branch set to a separate testing environment, and morning sanity checks run by our engineers oversees. This began with me taking ownership of running the FE release, which our CTO did previously. \n \n - Removed over 50,000 lines of code from my project as a by-product of consistent refactoring. \n \n",
