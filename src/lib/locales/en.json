Additionally, there's a job to auto-merge 'please feature me' pull requests under specific conditions. These actions are triggered on every push to the `main` branch, pull requests targeting `main`, and can also be manually triggered or scheduled. Environment variables such as `GIT_USER_EMAIL`, `GIT_USER_NAME`, and `README_G_TOKEN` are used for configuring Git user details and GitHub token. Explore individual scripts in the `.github/scripts` directory for more details on each functionality.",
