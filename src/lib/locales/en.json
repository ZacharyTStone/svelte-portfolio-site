			"description": "Main Tasks:\n\n- Managed a diverse range of tasks including bug tickets, support tasks, and new feature development, showcasing my ability to handle complex and varied responsibilities.\n\n- Worked directly with clients and helped write BRDs, feature briefs, tech specs, and other documentation.\n\n- Coordinated with design, engineering, and product teams.\n\n- Reviewed candidates' applications and conducted first-round interviews. \n\nNotable Accomplishments:\n\n- I implemented a reusable, robust project component library update following a Figma file.\n\n- Successfully tackled a unique challenge for the company by planning and creating an embeddable widget as part of a feature. This involved extensive research, front-end planning, and implementation and required me to liaise directly with various companies' engineering teams to ensure a smooth implementation, regardless of their website's framework.\n\nI worked with QA to update my project's QA process. This included better QA instructions, a weekly code review, a release branch set to a separate testing environment, and morning sanity checks run by our engineers. It began with me taking ownership of running the FE release, which our CTO did previously.\n\n- Improved the codebase significantly through consistent refactoring. While this is hard to quantify, I did remove over 50,000 lines of code from my project as a by-product of consistent refactoring.",
